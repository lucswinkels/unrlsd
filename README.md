# Unrlsd

Unrlsd is currently in development.

## Setup

To start, install all dependencies for the project with npm:

### `npm install`

In the project directory, run:

### `npx json-server -p 3006 -w data/db.json`

This will start the JSON-server on [http://localhost:3006](http://localhost:3000) so the app can communicate and fetch data from the database file.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
